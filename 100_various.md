###Introduction
This chapter will in contrast to the previous ones not be described in much detail, but will rather be a small overview of other cool, existing DIY lab equipment which isn't categorized yet and should work as a source repository for further expansion of the full reivew. You are kindly invited to make fresh branches and expand the database. For more info on contributing, please see the [contribute](CONTRIBUTE.md) file.

###3D imaging <a id="imaging"></a>


####Short description
Certain types of electromagnetic radiation can penetrate the bodies of living organisms, while showing a gradient of absorbance through different tissue types. As a result, the internal composition of a body can be scanned and reconstructed in 3D, which is immensely useful for research and especially medical applications. Included methods are x-ray computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), etc.

###DIY pumps and microfluidics <a id="microfluidics"></a>


####Short description
Microfluidics is an interesting field, spannig over different research areas, biology among others. The possibility to mix and experiment with samples in very small amounts and fast set-up design and fabrication is interesting for research in molecular biology, chromatography, neuroscience, etc.

###Optomechanical components <a id="optics"></a>


####Short description
Optomechanical components is a name for any optical parts, such as lenses, which are mechanically adjusted for focusing, magnification, etc. and are an important part of microscopy but also other research purposes.

###Sample handling <a id="sample"></a>

####Short description
This includes all devices, which can be used to work with samples and moving/transfering them.
