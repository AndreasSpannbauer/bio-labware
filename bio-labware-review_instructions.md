Anyone who wishes it, can add to our bio-labware review! But to maintain more-or-less clear and structured content, we have prepared some instructions on how to contribute. This will make contributions easier for us, for you and everyone else as well.

1. The posts are written in github markdown syntax.

2. All device-posts should have the same content structure, which is as follows:

- Background

  Describe why this technique is used and how, the principles behind it and add a few keywords
  
- Commercial variants

  Evaluate and approximate the costs of obtaning a commercial device
  
- Available DIY resources

  Here, the actual DIY resources are reviewed. Ephasize on the currently most developed projects (if any), their specifications, cost (if known) and applicability.
  
- Is DIY good enough and reasonable?

  Compare the DIY projects described above, with comercial devices, considering general use and requirements.
  
- Requirements and plans

  Briefly describe the requirements and focus points of the device type in general - what is most important for the device, to get a good evaluation.
  
3. We wish to moderate our content, so please be sure to contact us, if you would like to contribute. Every effort will be much appreciated!
