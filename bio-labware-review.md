#Bio Labware Review

## Overview
One of our goals at symbiolab is making a complete collection of affordable and DIY laboratory equipment, which is required for common methodology in a biological research lab. To do this, we will begin by making a list of required equipment, describing the hardware, its use, commercial costs and the current DIY status. This list will include links to some DIY examples, it will however not contain actual plans for our designs, this will come later (there will be links though, once available). To make the content more legible, the equipment will be organized into categories, such as preparation, microscopy, chromatography, proteomics,...

Saying this, while we plan to collect as much DIY equipment as possible, it is important to point out, that it doesn’t make sense, to make EVERYTHING DIY. Many tools, which are commonly used in a laboratory, are simply easier and cheaper to buy, than to make from scratch. This includes glassware (beakers, measuring cylinders, petri dishes, glasks,...), basic utensils and consumables (spoons, spatulas, scalpels, tweezers,...) and basic kitchenware (fridge/freezer, dishwasher, microwave oven,...). These tools will therefore not be added to the review list.

As their is an overflow of possibilities and devices for laboratory use, it is not unlikely, we will forget something in our list. If there is something that you miss, feel free to contact us and add suggestions.

###Fine Weighing Scale/ Microbalance <a id="Microbalance"></a>
####1. Background
Precise weighing of chemicals in solution preparation, measuring small samples... Essential for any “wet” experiment, containing buffers and other solutions, which need to have a precise composition. Depending on the amounts of source material, the scales require the appropriate precision. For the average laboratory use, a precision of 0,001g or better is favorable.

Keywords: fine, weighing, gram, milli, micro, precision, scale, balance

####2. Comercial variants
The cheapest weighing scales with the appropriate precision, usually cost 100€ or more, higher quality devices around 300€. Scales capable of measuring differences in the microgram scope, can however also cost up to several 1000€ . On the other hand, devices with a 0,01g precision are already available for less than 20€.

####3. Available DIY resources
There are several fine weighing scale/microbalance projects on the internet. Most of them are easy to build, mechanical balances, such as [example 1](http://sci-toys.com/scitoys/scitoys/mathematics/microgram_balance/balance.html). While these can be precise, they are very impractical to work with, since they require balancing of samples against premade weights, which have discrete masses. There are far less DIY projects for digital scales, which could be due a relatively low necessity and the many factors, which can influence the precision and accuracy of such devices (balancing, temperature, nonlinearity...). There are still some available, such as [example 2](http://makezine.com/2008/03/25/diy-digital-balance/), with detailed [instructions](http://www.sci-spot.com/Mechanical/balance.htm), or [example 3](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/hardware/hardware_info1.shtml), [example 4](https://www.behance.net/gallery/8021801/Electronic-Weight-Scale-DIY-Kit). While all of these are capable of fine measurements, their precision and accuracy is questionable. An exception could be the [openQCM](http://openqcm.com/), suitable for submicrogram samples, which operates on the principle of measuring sample oscillation at high frequencies. It is fully open source, promises high precision and accuracy and offers support for Windows, Linux and Mac.

####4. Is DIY good enough and reasonable?
Whether it is reasonable to build your own weighing scale, strongly depends on the samples you are going to measure. For material in the range of 0.01g or more, low-cost scales are readily available. However, if you need higher precision, making your own could save you a fair amount of money. Fine DIY weighing scales already exist, their main problem, however, is reliability, which is critical.

####5. Plan
For our purposes, a precision of 0.01-0.001g is satisfactory, therefore we do not plan to make a scale from scratch at this point.
